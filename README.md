# django-1.1-boilerplate
Boilerplate with a basic template and file structure

This boilerplate includes:
* A working django project with an `apps` directory and a `boilerplate_app` installed within.
* A single template `index.html` and three views functions `index`, `register`, `login`.
* All urls to tie these views functions together.
* An unfinished `User` model within `apps.boilerplate_app.models.py`
